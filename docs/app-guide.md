# puregraph app guide

Build and explore network diagrams from JSON, CSV, or TSV data.

## Using the app

1. Create a graph and import node and edge data.
2. Inspect nodes and connections, then choose a layout and adjust their styling.
3. Save the editable `.graph` document and use export controls when sharing a diagram.

## Development requirements

This app runs within [puredesktop](https://puredesktop.ai). Its local `@purescience/platform-*` dependencies, desktop bridge, and shared shell come from the parent suite and are not included in this repository. Use the matching suite development environment to install and run it; installing this repository alone is not sufficient for a complete desktop application.

With the shared dependencies available, use the scripts in `package.json` from the app directory:

```sh
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run typecheck
npm test
```

`dev` starts the development entry point; `build` prepares the app bundle. Tests and type checking require the same shared dependencies as the app. Host services such as file access and connected accounts must be provided by the suite.
